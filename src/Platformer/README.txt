IGORR Packed Version

---Requirements---
Since this game is made with XNA it will only run on Windows
with the XNA 4.0 framework installed. You can get it here: 
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914

Also the game requires .Net 4.0 as of now.

On top of that, I am not sure what graphics card features are required to run the game,
since it runs in the XNA highdef mode.


---How to play---
First you'll have to start the server(IGORR Server.exe) in the IGORR Server folder.
Then you can go into the Platformer folder and start up the Platformer.exe
This will take you to the really sparse main menu of the game


---Controls---
When you start the game you will not be able to jump until you find the Legs.
You start however with the overpowered grenade equipped.
You can use a Game Pad or the Keyboard to play.
